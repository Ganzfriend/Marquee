    "Think of London, a small city. Dark, dark in the daytime \
    People sleep, sleep in the daytime If they want to, if they want to \
    Im checking them out Im checking them out Ive got it figured out Im the one thats got it figured out  Theres good points some bad points \
    It all works out Im just a little freaked out \
    I will find a city find myself a city to live in find a city find myself a city to live in \
    Down El Paso way things get pretty spread out people got no idea where in the world they are they go up north and come back south \
    still got no idea where in the world they are \
    Im checking them out Im checking them out \
    Ive got it figured out Im the one thats got it figured out \
    theres good points some bad points it all works out Im just a little freaked out \
    There are a lot of rich people in Birmingham A lot of ghosts in a lot of houses \
    Look over there! dry ice factory a good place to get some thinking done \
    I will find a city find myself a city to live in \
    Did I forget to mention, to forget mention Memphis? \
    Home of Elvis and the ancient Greeks Do I smell? I smell home cooking \

    "Echoes of reggae comin' through my bedroom wall \
    Having a party up next door but I'm sittin here all alone \
    Two lovers in the bedroom and the other starts to shout \
    All I got is this blank stare and that don't carry no clout at all \

    He's singing and she's there to lend a hand \
    He's seen his name on the marquee but she will never understand \
    Once again he's leavin' and she's there with a tear in her eye \

    "And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack \
And you may find yourself in another part of the world \
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile \
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife \
And you may ask yourself, Well... how did I get here? \
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down \
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground \
Into the blue again after the money's gone \
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground \
And you may ask yourself, How do I work this? \
And you may ask yourself, Where is that large automobile? \
And you may tell yourself, This is not my beautiful house \
And you may tell yourself, This is not my beautiful wife \
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down \
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground \
Into the blue again after the money's gone \
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground \
Water dissolving and water removing \
There is water at the bottom of the ocean \
Under the water, carry the water \
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean \
Water dissolving and water removing", // -------------
"For a long time I felt Without style and grace Wearing shoes with no socks \
In cold weather I knew my heart Was in the right place I knew I'd be able \
To do these things And as we watch him Digging his own grave It is important to know \
That was where he's at He can't afford to stop That is what he believe \
He'll keep on digging For a thousand years I'm walking a line \
I'm thinking about empty motion I'm walking a line Just barely enough to be living \
Get outta the way (no time to begin) This isn't the time (so nothing was done) \
Not talking about (not many at all) I'm turning around (no trouble at all) \
You notice there's nothing around you, 'round you \
I'm walking a line Divide and dissolve Never get to say much Never get to talk \
Tell us a little bit But not too much Right about then Is where she give up \
She has closed her eyes She has give up hope I'm walking a line \
I hate to be dreaming in motion I'm walking a line \
Just barely enough to be living Get outta the way (no time to begin) \
This isn't the time (so nothing was done) Not talking about (not many at all) \
I'm turning around (no trouble at all) I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me \
I'm walking a line Divide and dissolve"
